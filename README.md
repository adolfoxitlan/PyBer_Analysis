# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

In the following chart, we can observe that Urban rides are low fare but many, the difference is exponential compared to Rural, letting Suburban right in the middle.

Also, we can see that even though the Urban rides are the most in terms of fares, there are a lot of drivers that don't get any rides.
